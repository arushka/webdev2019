        <p id="main">On the island of Maui, it's customary to play golf. The landscapes of this volcanic can be accurately described with the English expression “eye candy”: the soil of red color, covered with a bright green grass carpet, is emphasized by the deep blue of the ocean. Coupled with exotic vegetation and hotels, many of which are striking in their architecture, this creates an impressive effect.</p>
